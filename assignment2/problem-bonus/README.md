Preconditions: 
* "input.txt" exists in the current directory
* File contains a non-negative integer `n` in the first line
* Next line contains n space-seperated integers

Postconditions:
* Solution.java will generate a file named "output.txt"
* Line 1 of "output.txt" will contain the n space-seperated integers
as a min heap
* Line 2 will contain the array sorted in descending order
* "output.txt" will also contain the execution time for
running the algorithm, excluding time of input/output.
This time will be in nanoseconds.

To run:
1. Create a valid file "input.txt" in the current directory
2. Run `javac Solution.java`
3. Run `java Solution.java`
